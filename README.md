# QA-Basic-Automatization
In this repository are the basic configurations to automate a web page

To create a new project we do the following:

In our editor (in my case Eclipse) we go to the option of: 
1) File->New->Other->Maven Project (next)
2) in the next view, fill the next fields: Group Id: com.[companyname].[projectname] and in the field Artifact Id fill with the [functionalityName]


With that help us to use, download dependencies that we need later.
